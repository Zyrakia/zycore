> I made this package with my project/future project needs in mind. This means that I will go into this package and change things whenever I need something changed for my project. To be short, expect breaking changes, changes that may affect your project and the way it behaves, so if you need something in this package, either install it and then don't update unless you know what has changed, or go grab only the utilities you need fro the repo.

# Zycore

Just a bunch of utilities thrown together since I don't like copying the files between my projects manually.
Feel free to contribute any new utilities or corrections.
This package exports quite a few very generically named namespaces and classes, if you would like to avoid that kind of pollution installing this package is not your best choice. The repo will always remain open so if you want to grab a specific namespace or class go ahead :D
